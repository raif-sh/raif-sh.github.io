End of the line for mybump gig. Unable to get approval for visa, got recommended to seek a better opportunity for employment pass in Malaysia. 

*What are my thoughts and how should I prepare for the next phase of this journey?*

Important Points:
- Special pass expires on Feb 8; need to book tickets for same date to fly back ASAP.
  - Extend the premium flex ticket to May 15th (assuming I fly back Feb ~15th).
- Complete product documentation and get a checklist of tasks for handover.
- Get recommendation letter and referrals from MM.
  - Discuss salary split to help with the debt - Give back RM 2,000 from (8k salary?)

# msg to MM

I've taken some time to think about what we discussed.

It would be best to apply to all possible opportunities and attempt interviews even at lottiefiles. As you guys also emphasized I need to focus on getting a work visa + good salary to improve the situation.

Since, my salary on paper was RM 5,000 here, I figured a jump to RM 8,000+ should be a good starting point? 

I've decided to continue our arrangement; I'll transfer atleast RM 2,000 from my salary. I want to help out with the debts, pending payments and/or help save some rainy day fund.

Here are things I need from you:
- Deliverables you want me to complete in this period.
- Help with recommendation letter.
- Referrals/Intros for job interviews.

Meanwhile, I'll update my CV/LinkedIn and prepare a document of work done/in-progress in product as a holdover. 

Here are things I think I should finish up:
- [ ] Blog content audit
- [ ] Main website audit
- [ ] Marketing/sales funnel from website to dashboard
- [ ] DIY campaign launching (for under RM 20k)
  - [ ] Printing Partner
  - [ ] Sticker Installer
