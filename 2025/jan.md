learning and practicing basic JS string methods and manipulation. learnt about new stuff that was released in 2022 like `at(i)` which can select a character at certain index and `replace(x,y)` which can replace keywords easily.

second thing i started learning were conditionals, and i just covered only the first lesson on comparisions, theres still alot more to cover in conditionals before i can start the assignment.

got a refresher on js functions, declaring and calling it. practiced few js string manupulation methods by taking an input in function and capitalizing first and last name with a function. got to practice `charAt` and `at` which selects a single character from a string which is then used to capitalize with `toUpperCase`. Using `slice()` we remove that character from original string and later append the capitalize character when returning the result. good refreshers. and also learnt about anonymous functions and the more modern way of using arrow functions to make code look easy to read and type doing the same work. need to practice arrow functions in upcoming exercises. The next unit is on problem solving which has a hour long lecture and lot of theory to read. Was tempted to rush through but keeping it for tomorrow.
