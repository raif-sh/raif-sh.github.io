learning and practicing basic JS string methods and manipulation. learnt about new stuff that was released in 2022 like `at(i)` which can select a character at certain index and `replace(x,y)` which can replace keywords easily.

second thing i started learning were conditionals, and i just covered only the first lesson on comparisions, theres still alot more to cover in conditionals before i can start the assignment.

got a refresher on js functions, declaring and calling it. practiced few js string manupulation methods by taking an input in function and capitalizing first and last name with a function. got to practice `charAt` and `at` which selects a single character from a string which is then used to capitalize with `toUpperCase`. Using `slice()` we remove that character from original string and later append the capitalize character when returning the result. good refreshers. and also learnt about anonymous functions and the more modern way of using arrow functions to make code look easy to read and type doing the same work. need to practice arrow functions in upcoming exercises. The next unit is on problem solving which has a hour long lecture and lot of theory to read. Was tempted to rush through but keeping it for tomorrow.

Coding isn't about language - there are 8 main concepts, they work the same in almost all languages.

Write out the concepts or algorithm in plain english first, then convert to code later.

Comments are code - to explain the code to other programmers. WRONG! Comments are there to explain your code to your computer

1. new variable - name, type & initial value
   1. how to write an algorithm - write in english, not coding. `create a variable called name of type 'type' that starts with value 'initVal'`
   2. for code - in python it will be `name = initVal`

Read this article on [problem solving by learning how to think like a programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/).

It stated the process we usually fall into trying random things instead of having a framework and practicing a healthy approach to problem solving. Its interesting to learn that what makes the difference between good and bad programmers are one is curious and the other gets irritated by bugs or problems.

In programming failure is a good thing and one should expect this every minute.

There are three stages in the process of problem solving; starting with understanding the problem
1. plan - don't start coding or open computer, do this on paper first. 
2.  Pseudocode - write in plain language, the logic for the program 
3.  Divide and conquer - break main problem to sub problems and start solving small

Read the first chapter from the book `Think like a programmer by V. Anton Spraul` - I finally learned how to play sudoku and learnt alot more about approaching with a plan to solve problems without trying random things.

Good and bad news. The bad - Forgot to write and reflect on what i have been learning. Good - been diligently following the TOP curriculum and busy with doing js exercises which is 85% of the foundation content. 

Last few days I was grinding on js exercises and i realized the commits and push to github for the forked repo of exercises doesnt count as a contribution i made. i forgot to check the github streaks on contributions on my phone until yesterday i saw that those commits don't count - unless its pushed to the original repo and merged with them. and that makes sense.

today i started learning about DOM manipulations and getting into the nitty gritty stuff of javascript working on HTML. Previously working with vuejs i was spoilt and didnt need to learn any of this stuff. but its great learning about the basic stuff and doing it right this time.. 

there is mounting pressure to finish this as soon as possible and start applying for jobs by end of february.

this is the last entry for january, closing of the first month of 2025 so soon. goal for next month is to maintain this momentum and improve my consistency and daily routine around self-care, study and work.
