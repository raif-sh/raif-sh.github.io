learning and practicing basic JS string methods and manipulation. learnt about new stuff that was released in 2022 like `at(i)` which can select a character at certain index and `replace(x,y)` which can replace keywords easily.

second thing i started learning were conditionals, and i just covered only the first lesson on comparisions, theres still alot more to cover in conditionals before i can start the assignment.

got a refresher on js functions, declaring and calling it. practiced few js string manupulation methods by taking an input in function and capitalizing first and last name with a function. got to practice `charAt` and `at` which selects a single character from a string which is then used to capitalize with `toUpperCase`. Using `slice()` we remove that character from original string and later append the capitalize character when returning the result. good refreshers. and also learnt about anonymous functions and the more modern way of using arrow functions to make code look easy to read and type doing the same work. need to practice arrow functions in upcoming exercises. The next unit is on problem solving which has a hour long lecture and lot of theory to read. Was tempted to rush through but keeping it for tomorrow.

Coding isn't about language - there are 8 main concepts, they work the same in almost all languages.

Write out the concepts or algorithm in plain english first, then convert to code later.

Comments are code - to explain the code to other programmers. WRONG! Comments are there to explain your code to your computer

1. new variable - name, type & initial value
   1. how to write an algorithm - write in english, not coding. `create a variable called name of type 'type' that starts with value 'initVal'`
   2. for code - in python it will be `name = initVal`

Read this article on [problem solving by learning how to think like a programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/).

It stated the process we usually fall into trying random things instead of having a framework and practicing a healthy approach to problem solving. Its interesting to learn that what makes the difference between good and bad programmers are one is curious and the other gets irritated by bugs or problems.

In programming failure is a good thing and one should expect this every minute.
