# 22

learning and practicing basic JS string methods and manipulation. learnt about new stuff that was released in 2022 like `at(i)` which can select a character at certain index and `replace(x,y)` which can replace keywords easily.

second thing i started learning were conditionals, and i just covered only the first lesson on comparisions, theres still alot more to cover in conditionals before i can start the assignment.
